## Overview of the School District Analysis: 
The purpose of this project is to provide the academic analysis especially the math and reading grades for Thomas High School to the school board because there is evidence shown of academic dishonesty.  To achieve that, we replace the ninth grade’s reading and math score to NaN for Thomas High school then do the academic analysis.
